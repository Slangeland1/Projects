# SLpackage

This package produces summary statistics that are useful for presentation 
purposes and exploratory data analysis.

## Example

The goal of this package is to identify missing (`NA`) values.  Verify that
all missing values are coded as `NA` rather than a blank before running this function.
This function will not identify a blank value as a missing value.  Replace all blanks
with `NA` before running this function.

```{r}
example_string <- c(1:99, " ", " ", NA, NA)
example_string

obs_less_na(x = example_string,
            y = "This table will not identify blanks as NAs")

blanks <- which(example_string == " ")

example_string[blanks] <- NA

obs_less_na(x = example_string,
            y = "Blanks have been replaced with NA")
```
