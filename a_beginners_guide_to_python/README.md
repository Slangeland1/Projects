# A Beginner's Guide to Python

_Author:_ Stephanie Langeland, Advanced Analytics, `stephanie.langeland@slalom.com`

_Purpose:_ During my down time, I started putting together these files as I was
(and still am) learning Python.  This project is a __work in progress__ rather than
a finished product because I have much more to learn. I hope to add to this repo
over time. Prior to this, my main coding language was R so some basic coding
fundamentals were not covered.  This was a somewhat self guided effort so all
comments, suggestions, and tips are welcome.

_The following is an ordered list of resources I used to learn Python:_

1. Installation: https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/

2. Optional: A server extension for Jupyter notebook which provides configuration
interfaces for notebook extensions (nbextensions):
https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator 

    * Note: Install the most up-to-date version of PyHamcrest as well:
    https://pypi.org/project/PyHamcrest/

3. Intro to Jupyter notebooks (refer to "01_tutorial.ipynb" code file):
https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/

4. Read "A Whirlwind Tour of Python" by Jake VanderPlas:
https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython

5. Read the "Style Guide for Python Code": https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

6. Read the "Python Data Science Handbook" by Jake VanderPlas:
https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/

7. Read "5 Data Science Projects That Will Get You Hired in 2018" by John
Sullivan (many of the topics discussed here are also covered in the code files
noted in the next section below):
https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/06/5-data-science-projects-hired.html 

8. Machine Learning in Python - scikit-learn tutorials (many of the topics
discussed here are also covered in the code files noted in the next section
below): http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html

9. Additional Resources:

    * Tutorials noted below in the next section.

    * "Learn Python" by codecademy: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python?composer_curriculum_redirect=python

    * "Google's Python Class": https://developers.google.com/edu/python/ 

    * "Pandas Cookbook" by Theodore Petrou

    * "Python Cookbook" by Brian Jones, David Beazley

    * Python OOP Tutorial 1: Classes and Instances: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDa-Z5JzLYM

_The following outlines the purpose of each sub folder contained herein:_

Sub Folder Name:  Description

code:  Code files are stored here.  These files are numbered and should be reviewed in order
starting at "00_". __Note: It is best to download the html file for each in order to view the finished product.__
 
input_output_files:  Input & output files are stored here.  Refer to the header at the top of each
code file for which input files were used and which output files were created in that code file.

raw_data:  All input files are saved here in their original form to preserve
original copies.

reports:  All project documents are saved here such as a code book, project plan, 
paper drafts, etc. (when applicable).

data_info:  All supporting documents about the data sets saved in the input_output_files
and raw_data folders are stored here.  There is a "File Directory" file that lists
each input file, input file source, output file, raw data file, and report(s) that
correspond to each code file.
