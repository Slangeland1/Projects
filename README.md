__"An Analysis of the Impact of Neighbors’ Expectations on Regional Home Values" (April 2017)__
   
   * Built logistic regression models using past home values and homeowners’ expectations of future neighborhood home values to
predict actual home prices for nine regions of the U.S. Yielded a 53% prediction accuracy rate, driven by predictions of
downturns in the housing market as a result of the Great Recession. As the housing market improves and more data become
available, this model should successfully predict upticks in the market.  

   * Logistic regression models, data visualizations, and confusion matrices were run in R.
   
   * Refer to the "Data Analysis Final Project" (https://github.com/Slangeland1/Projects/tree/master/An%20Analysis%20of%20the%20Impact%20of%20Neighbors%E2%80%99%20Expectations%20on%20Regional%20Home%20Values_Stephanie%20Langeland) folder for the R code, input files, and paper. 
   
    * Completed as part of the QMSS program at Columbia University.

__"Stop Don't Hit" (April 2017)__

   * Based on geospatial analysis of 2015 NYPD Stop, Question and Frisk data, determined that the Bronx had the highest volume of
stop and frisk events. Analyzed the Bronx to understand the impact of human bias when making the decision to stop, question,
and frisk a suspect based on the demography of the vicinity. Results did not produce statistically significant evidence that police
officers stop and frisk based on race or gender. Showcased spatial hotspots where more police force was used on people with
heavier builds regardless of whether the suspect was armed.

__"Predicting Weather Trends" (December 2016)__
   
   * I used exploratory data analysis to display and understand trends in weather data from Weather Underground. After exploring the data, I used actual mean temperature, actual minimum temperature, actual maximum temperature, average minimum temperature, average maximum temperature, record minimum temperature, record maximum temperature, actual precipitation, and record precipitation to predict whether average precipitation was above or below the overall average precipitation rate of 0.11. Linear and quadratic models were fit using lasso, logit, and partial least squares regression. The goal was to find a model with the lowest MSE (mean squared error) and most importantly, the highest rate of prediction accuracy in the testing data.

__"An Empirical Analysis of Strategic Games in the Tri-Party Repo Market" (March 2015)__

   * This paper discusses the strategies of clearing banks, securities dealers, and cash investors in the tri-party repo market using game theory and multiple regression analysis. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Bank of New York Mellon, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis were recorded on a quarterly basis after the Primary Dealer Credit Facility’s closure, from February 2010 through September 2014. Empirical results indicate that real Gross Domestic Product and the collateral value of agency mortgage-backed securities for repos significantly influence tri-party repo activity. These factors can motivate players’ strategies, which partly determines the size of the tri-party repo market and supports game theoretic insights about this market’s sensitivity to strategic and external uncertainty.

   * Presented at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Undergraduate Research Conference.
