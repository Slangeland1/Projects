This repo contains relevant coursework completed as part of **Stephanie Langeland's** master's degree at Columbia University in the Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) program.

1) "Predicting Weather Trends" (Dec 2016)
   
   * I used exploratory data analysis to display and understand trends in weather data from Weather Underground. After exploring the data, I used actual mean temperature, actual minimum temperature, actual maximum temperature, average minimum temperature, average maximum temperature, record minimum temperature, record maximum temperature, actual precipitation, and record precipitation to predict whether average precipitation was above or below the overall average precipitation rate of 0.11. Linear and quadratic models were fit using lasso, logit, and partial least squares regression. The goal was to find a model with the lowest MSE (mean squared error) and most importantly, the highest rate of prediction accuracy in the testing data.

2) "An Analysis of the Impact of Neighbors’ Expectations on Regional Home Values" (Jan - Apr 2017)
   
   * Built a residential real estate model that summarized past, current, and forecasted the future housing market for nine regions of the United States.  The model used homeowners’ opinions of the past value of their homes and expected future values of the homes in their neighborhoods to predict changes in actual home prices.  

   * Logistic regression models, data visualizations, and confusion matrices were run in R.
   
   * Refer to the "Data Analysis Final Project" (https://github.com/Slangeland1/Relevant-Coursework/tree/master/Data%20Analysis%20Final%20Project) folder for the R code, input files, and paper. 

3) "Stop Don't Hit" (Jan - Apr 2017)

   * Data Science group visualized cluster analysis of NYPD Stop, Question and Frisk data by location and volume of stop and frisk events in New York City in 2015 to build forecasting models that predicted the likelihood of being stopped and frisked in certain locations. The goal of the study was to understand the impact of human bias when making the decision the stop, question, and frisk someone based on the demography of the vicinity.
