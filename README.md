__The following is a compilation of small projects to demonstrate various skills:__

  * [SQL in R](https://github.com/Slangeland1/Projects/blob/master/SQL%20in%20R/Langeland_Stephanie_hw10.md)

  * [Text Mining]()
  
  * [Web Scraping](https://github.com/Slangeland1/Projects/blob/master/Web%20Scraping/Langeland_Stephanie_hw09.md)
  
  * [Writing an API Client](https://github.com/Slangeland1/Projects/blob/master/Writing%20an%20API%20Client/Langeland_Stephanie_hw08.md)

__"An Analysis of the Impact of Neighbors’ Expectations on Regional Home Values" (April 2017)__
   
   * Built __logistic regression models__ using past home values and homeowners’
   expectations of future neighborhood home values to predict actual home prices
   for nine regions of the U.S. Yielded a 53% prediction accuracy rate, driven by
   predictions of downturns in the housing market as a result of the Great Recession.
   As the housing market improves and more data become available, this model should
   successfully predict upticks in the market.

__"Stop Don't Hit" (April 2017)__

  * Based on __geospatial analysis__ of 2015 NYPD Stop, Question and Frisk
  data, determined that the Bronx had the highest volume of stop and frisk
  events. Analyzed the Bronx to understand the impact of human bias when
  making the decision to stop, question, and frisk a suspect based on the
  demography of the vicinity. Results did not produce statistically significant
  evidence that police officers stop and frisk based on race or gender. Showcased
  spatial hotspots where more police force was used on people with heavier
  builds regardless of whether the suspect was armed.

__"Predicting Weather Trends" (December 2016)__
   
  * I used exploratory data analysis to display and understand trends in weather
  data from Weather Underground. After exploring the data, I used actual mean
  temperature, actual minimum temperature, actual maximum temperature, average
  minimum temperature, average maximum temperature, record minimum temperature,
  record maximum temperature, actual precipitation, and record precipitation to
  predict whether average precipitation was above or below the overall average
  precipitation rate of 0.11. Linear and quadratic models were fit using lasso,
  logit, and partial least squares regression. The goal was to find a model with
  the lowest MSE (mean squared error) and most importantly, the highest rate of
  prediction accuracy in the testing data.

__"An Empirical Analysis of Strategic Games in the Tri-Party Repo Market" (March 2015)__

  * Extended previous game theory research to __multiple regression analysis__ to
  compare actual market conditions against potential factors that may influence
  strategic decisions of tri-party repo market participants.

  * Empirical results used to formulate monetary policy recommendations aimed
  at enhancing firm and central bank preparedness for systemic crises arising
  from behavioral shifts of market participants.

  * One of thirty papers selected to present findings at the __Federal Reserve__
  __Bank of Dallas Undergraduate Research Conference.__
